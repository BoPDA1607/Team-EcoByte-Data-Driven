# Introduction
Basic tutorial on how to (relatively) conveniently use Google Colab with Google Drive and Github

### What is Colab
Itâ€™s a Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup to use.
Moreover it gives you **free GPU** access to run your code.

In simple words Colab is a free hosted Jupyter notebook with access to GPU.

#### Important information
* Colab Runtime - Instance of Jupyter notebook. 
    ##### Security considerations
    Make sure you trust the authors of any notebook before executing it. 
    
    With a local connection, the code you execute can read, write, and delete files on your computer.
    Connecting to a Jupyter notebook server running on your local machine can provide many benefits. 
    With these benefits come serious potential risks. 
    By connecting to a local runtime, 
    you are allowing the Colaboratory frontend to execute code in the notebook using the local resources on your machine. 
    This means that the notebook could:
    * Invoke arbitrary commands (i.e. "rm -rf /")
    * Access the local file system
    * Run malicious content on your machine
    
    Before attempting to connect to a local runtime, make sure you trust the authors of the notebook and ensure you understand what code is being executed. For more information on the Jupyter notebook server's security model, consult Jupyter's documentation.

* Colab stores the notebooks in your Google Drive. 
    (Although limited integration with github is also possible, more on this in *Quick Start*)

* All the files uploaded to Colab are **ephemeral**, they are **gone** after reloading Colab Runtime.

    The recommended way is to upload your data to Google Drive then mount the drive in the Runtime (instructions in **Quick Start**)
    
* Colab provides integration with Github. It's possible to load notebooks directly from repositories 
and commit changes made in Colab. However, there are some limitations (more in **Quick Start**)

* This tutorial shows just one way of using Colab, everyone should adjust the flow accordingly.

##  Quick Start

1. Create Github repository and push Jupyter Notebook (can be empty) into it 
(if you already have a notebook that you want to run in colab in some other repository you can skip this step.)

2. Go to <https://colab.research.google.com/>, pick *GITHUB* source and put the repository details

3. Click on **NEW PYTHON 3 NOTEBOOK** and that's (almost) it! Now you can write and run your code in Colab using Google GPUs

#### Using GPUs
**Warning** This will reload your runtime!

Navigate to: Runtime -> Change runtime type -> Hardware accelerator -> pick GPU (or TPU)
