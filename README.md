# Project
Pipeline machine learning

### What is Colab
Itâ€™s a Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup to use.
Moreover it gives you **free GPU** access to run your code.

### Get started
1. Copy the GitHub Repository Link: https://github.com/BoPDA1607/Team-EcoByte-Data-Driven

2. Access Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/

3. Connect to the GitHub Repository

4. Open the Notebook named "PreprocessingData.ipynb", change /Data to your directory and Run.

5. Open the Notebook named "PipelineModels.ipynb", change /Data to your directory and Run.

6. Check your directory

#### Using GPUs
**Warning** This will reload your runtime!

Navigate to: Runtime -> Change runtime type -> Hardware accelerator -> pick GPU (or TPU)
